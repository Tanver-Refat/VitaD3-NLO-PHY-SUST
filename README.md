This repository contains Python codes related to Z-scan profiling.

"UV spectrum.ipynb" is used for visualizing the UV-Vis absorption spectrum from a .csv or .txt file generated by UV-Vis Spectrometers. It can also show the absorbance at a particular wavelength on an inset graph inside it. Also, the linear absorption coefficient (alpha) can be found. 

"Z_scan_Final.ipynb" will read data from a folder where .csv format files will be used for visualizing closed aperture Z-scan profiles and calculating and measuring further parameters  such as nonlinear phase shift.
This code mainly consisted of two portions,
1. The first portion is used for reading the main .csv files from the folder and plotting the closed aperture profiles for each of the files in the folder. and for each file, the computed values will be then saved on a newly created .csv file for each of the folders. Here this portion will calculate different files containing data for different powers.
2. The second portion will take that newly created data frame (.csv file) from the first portion as its input, and then will further calculate various calculations and plotting. Here the calculations will be for the whole folder containing the data of a sample.

These codes were developed in the "Google collaboratory" environment. That is why the file input and output destinations are represented in this manner.
